# Data Science Foundations, Lab 3: Practice with Feature Engineering and Pipelines

<br>

In this lab we will continue to practice creation of pipelines and feature engineering. We will use the wine dataset.

# L1 Q1: 

Fill in any missing data in your dataset using imputation and use this new data for Q2-Q3


```python
# Code Cell for L1 Q1
```

# L1 Q2:

Use 3 different scaling methods on the input data and evaluate how they affect VIF, kurtosis, and skew




```python
# Code Cell for L1 Q2
```

# L1 Q3:

Create a Pipeline using one of the scaling methods in sklearn and linear or logistic regression 

If you are using the wine dataset:
**_dependent variable:_** wine quality




```python
# Code Cell for L1 Q3
```
